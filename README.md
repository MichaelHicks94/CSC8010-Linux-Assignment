# CSC8010-Linux-Assignment
The practical assessment for CSC8010 (Computer Environments). The goal of the coursework was to create a series of Linux shell scripts designed to complete set exercises. The aim of the coursework was to enable us to practice Linux commands and Linux shell scripting.

Problem Specification:

a) Write a shell script which adds up 10 numbers entered by the user and displays the
result to the screen. You must use the “ read” command to obtain the numbers from
the user. (4 marks)
b) Alter the script you wrote in part a) of this question so that it works for an arbitrary
list of numbers. Again, you must use the “read” command to obtain all input from
the user. (5 marks)
c) Write a script which takes in a number from the user and prints out the
corresponding day of the week, e.g. Monday for 1 and Sunday for 7. Try, if you can,
to make sure the program doesn’t crash if the user enters something unexpected. (5
marks)
d) Write a script which makes a new directory called “MyTextFiles”, copies all text
files (i.e. those ending in “.txt” – you can ignore any permutations such as “.TXT”)
from the current directory to this new directory, produces a list of files within that
directory redirected to a new file called “DirectoryListing.txt” and displays on the
screen the number of lines in the file, “DirectoryListing.txt”.
(5 marks)
e) Write a shell script which looks at the contents of the current directory and for all
directories prints out the word “Directory” followed by the name of the directory and
a comma-separated list of the directory’s contents and for all files prints out the word
“File” and the name of the file.
(6 marks)
